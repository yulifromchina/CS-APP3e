# Introduction for data lab

The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with bit-level representations of integers and
floating point numbers. You’ll do this by solving a series of programming “puzzles.” Many of these puzzles
are quite artificial, but you’ll find yourself thinking much more about bits in working your way through
them. For more details, please read [the Writeup](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/datalab.pdf).
