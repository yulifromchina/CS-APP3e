# Why is it here ?

The reading materials for labs is the book , Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3/E (CS:APP3e), which is famous in IT Industry. It helps programmers understand their program better and deeper. When I reading the book, I accomplished some of them and recorded them here, for sharing and discussing.
